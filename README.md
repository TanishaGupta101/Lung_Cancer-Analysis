# Lung_Cancer-Analysis
In this project, I have used Data Science and ML approach and tried to analyze the Lung Cancer Data Set and also to visualize the impact of smoking on the health of the smokers leading to lung cancer.  Here we have seen how smoking results in lung cancer among people of different age groups and also which age-group people are smoking the most.  Later, I have also divided the dataset into Train and Test data and used few ML-Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM and Naive Bayes to do a comparative study of the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC Score and the Confusion Matrix.
